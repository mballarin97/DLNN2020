In this report we will tackle two different problems using the deep reinforcement learning framework. This means that we will
have an environment where a agent can perform actions, which will change the state of the environment, and receive 
a reward dependent on the new state. The reinforcement learning
problems are usually represented like a game, and so if the agent solves the environment we can say that he wins the game. We will
use a neural network to control the actions of the agent, and optimize it to win the environment. We will use the environments provided
by OpenAI in their python library, namely gym \cite{gym}.

The report will be divided as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduction, where we introduce our work;
    \item Cartpole, where we try to balance a pole on a cart knowing its position, velocity and the pole's angle and angular velocity;
    \item Cartpole with pixels, where we tackle the same problem as above, but using as input of the neural network only the rendered image of the cartpole. We will 
        see that the learning will become really more difficult, since the network should infer the information about the state and then learn to control
        the agent;
    \item Lunar Landing, where we tackle a different problem: manage to land with a spaceship using its engines. The description is a little more 
        involved of the one above, and we will so go into details in Section \ref{sec:LunLand};
    \item Appendix, where we will report most of the images;
