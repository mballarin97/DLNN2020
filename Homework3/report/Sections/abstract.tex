In this report we will review the deep reinforcement learning framework. We will see that it is a really tough task, due to its dynamical
nature. In particular, we will adress the environment of the Cartpole, the Cartpole using the screen as input and the Lunar Landing game
from the gym package. We will focus on the convergence speed and on tricks to improve the learning procedure.
