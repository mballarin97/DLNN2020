In this report we will tackle two different problems using the supervised deep learning framework. This means that we will
have datasets $D$ formed of couples $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1,\dots,N}$, where $x_i$ are the samples and $y_i$ the labels.
The report will be divided into four main Sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduction, where we introduce our work;
    \item Regression, where through a deep neural network we try to predict the behavior of a curve;
    \item Classification, where through a convolutional neural network we try to classify the handwritten digits from $0$ to $9$ using
        the MNSIT dataset;
    \item Appendix, where we will add images that are not fundamental for the flow of the report, but may be useful.
\end{enumerate}
