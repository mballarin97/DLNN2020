In this report we will review the regression task on a polynomial function of unknown order and a classification task on 
the MNIST dataset. We will review with particular attention the use of optimizers, regularization methods, hyperparameters
optimization and feature visualization for the networks. The code related to this work will be provided as an attachment
and as a link to a github repository in the Appendix.
