We present here images that can be interesting but are not fundamental for the report.

    \caption{Hyperparameters search for the classification task. We plotted with a color which is proportional to the loss function,
    reported in log-scale. The darker the color, the better the result. We notice that a really high L2 regularization 
    usually translates in a low loss score.}
