The development of the code for this week did not present particular challenges. 
It was an easy application of the theory seen in class and there was not a particularly
involved task. 

An interesting further study would be to use the techniques of sparse matrix to represent the quantum states,
which enables us to allocate far less memory, storing only the non-zero components of the matrix and their 
positions.
