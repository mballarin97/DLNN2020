In this report we will review several tasks related to unsupervised learning, focusing on the models called autoencoders.
We will optimize their architecture and employ them for different tasks, like image generation, denoising and transfer learning. We will 
finally implement a more advanced type of autoencoder, the Variational Autoencoder, and analyze its performances. We will use the
MNIST dataset.
